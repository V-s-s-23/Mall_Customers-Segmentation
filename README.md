# Mall_Customers-Segmentation using KMeans Clustering
## DataSet Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers

 # Data Information:- This dataset is composed by the following five features:

## 1.CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to the customer
## 2.Gender: Gender of the customer
## 3.Age: Age of the customer
## 4.Annual Income (k$): Annual Income of the customer
## 5.Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

# Dependences :- Here are the dependences I use in order to develope a solution for this problem-
## 1.Pandas
## 2.Numpy
## 3. Matplotlib
## 4.Seaborn
## 5.Scikit-learn

# Explanation:
This project involved unsupervised machine learning techniques. In this project, I did data analysis to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
During the EDA phase, I uncovered some interesting insights about customer behavior and patterns. To further analyze and understand these patterns, I used the KMeans algorithm to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.
To determine the optimal number of clusters for the KMeans algorithm, I employed the elbow method. This technique helped me identify the right number of clusters for grouping the customers effectively.
